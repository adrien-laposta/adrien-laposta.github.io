About me
======
After a master degree in Grenoble (Université Grenoble Alpes) in subatomic physics and cosmology, I prepared a thesis in Cosmology at Laboratoire de Physique des 2 Infinis Irène Joliot Curie ([IJCLab](https://www.ijclab.in2p3.fr/)), under the supervision of [Thibaut Louis](https://thibautlouis.github.io/). During my thesis, I mainly focused on the tension between local and CMB-derived measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe. I have studied the existence of potential instrumental systematic contamination in the best CMB datasets available to date and investigated a promising theoretical solution to the tension called Early Dark Energy (see a list of my publication for more details). 

As part of the ACT Power Spectrum working group, I contribute to the analysis of the sixth data release of primary CMB power spectra from data collected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope ([ACT](https://act.princeton.edu/)). The aim of this instrument was to measure the small scale CMB polarization anisotropies from the Atacama desert. We have already provided a map of the reconstructed gravitational lensing of CMB photons from ACT DR6 data (2017-2021) which probes the matter density along the line of sight (see [here](https://www.in2p3.cnrs.fr/fr/cnrsinfo/la-collaboration-act-devoile-une-nouvelle-carte-de-la-distribution-de-la-matiere-noire) for a CNRS press release I contributed to). The primary ACT DR6 power spectra analysis is still ongoing, and has allowed to strenghten the [PSpipe] data analysis pipeline which will be used to perform the analysis of the Simons Observatory ([SO](https://simonsobservatory.org/)) Large Aperture Telescope data. 

As a postdoctoral research assistant at Oxford University, I recently joined the SO-BB working group with the aim of providing a robust power spectrum analysis pipeline to analyse the first data from Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes that are expected to be available during 2024.
