======
I am a PhD student in Cosmology working in Laboratoire de Physique des 2 Infinis Ir√®ne Joliot Curie ([IJCLab](https://www.ijclab.in2p3.fr/)), under the supervision of [Thibaut Louis](https://thibautlouis.github.io/). My research is focused on the analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. I am currently involved in two different experiments, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope ([ACT](https://act.princeton.edu/)) and the Simons Observatory ([SO](https://simonsobservatory.org/)), that aim at measuring the small scale polarization anisotropies from the Atacama desert.
